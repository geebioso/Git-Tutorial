# Github Tutorial 

This is a tutorial on the basic functionality of github using the command line.

To use git on a mac, the easiest way to install is by installing xcode
command line tools. 

On linux, you can install by running

from the terminal. 

Windows users can install git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/win ) and can
